# Pathfinding Algorithm

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About this project

This is the most fun project I've worked on so far. It uses [Dijkstra's Algorithm](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/dijkstras-shortest-path-algorithm-visual-introduction/#:~:text=Dijkstra's%20Algorithm%20finds%20the%20shortest,node%20and%20all%20other%20nodes.) to find and animate the shortest path between two nodes. You can also build walls across the grid to prevent nodes from being "visited".

If you're interested in the implementation of the algorithm, then you'll be glad to know that I did my best to comment all the code I wrote, as well as explain what role each piece is playing.

The project is still in its first version, so I'm going to make more improvements every now and then.

I really enjoyed building this project and look forward to adding more algorithms to the collection. Here's the [link to the website](https://pathfinding-algorithm-ikk.netlify.app/). Enjoy!
